#Requirements

- [npm](https://github.com/isaacs/npm): You are also able to install this without npm, but npm makes your life so much easier. 
I recommend you to follow [this snippet](http://gist.github.com/579814) to install npm safely(do NOT run npm as ROOT).

#Install

`npm install google-openid`

#Run

Inside `examples` folder run the following command:
  
    node index.js

Next point your browser to http://localhost:8888/ to see it working.
